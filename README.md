// Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The purpose of the project is to design a system for DriverPass, that allows to study and train for their driver’s test.  
The system will allow users to manage their account and appointments, as well as study online.  The website will be managed 
by the owner as well as other assigned employees.  They will be permitted access to view appointments, make notes, check schedules, 
etc.  The client for this project is Liam, the owner of DriverPass.  Liam wants his system to allow people to enroll in online 
or in person courses that will prepare them for their driving test.  He would like the system to allow the user to make a profile 
and be able to manage it.  The profile will allow them to access their online courses, manage in person drivers training, view status 
and notes from their courses, as well as create a secure profile to store their data.  On the control side of the system, Liam would 
like access to be granted as well as be able to remove access, to his employees.  They should be able to access the schedule, make 
otes and update test progress, and view updates received from the DMV.   

// What did you do particularly well?
The part that I did well was listening to what the client was looking for and creating a business requirements document that outlined that.  
I had to determine the objectives and goals and the functional and nonfunctional requirements as well. 

// If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The part of the document that I would want to revise are the different charts we had to submit in the final project.  I believe there 
are more details to the project that could have possibly been added. 

// How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I implemented the user's needs and implemented them into the system by determing what will make using the system easier and better for them.  The system 
must be simple and easy to navigate, as well as allow the user to customize and manage their accounts. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing 
because in the end, they are the ones that will be using it.  If they do not have a good experience using the website, then they are most likely not going to use it, leading to 
less traffic, which is not what the client wants.

// How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach design software first by organizing my notes and information from the client and then creating a schedule to stay on task.  
I then break up the project into sections, to stay on task and to make sure that each part is given the necessary attention.  This 
also allows me to manage flaws as needed, to catch them before getting to deep into the design.
